# HR_Analytics_Dashboard---PowerBI

This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI. It highlights employee demographics, attrition patterns, and department-level performance to help HR teams make better decisions.

The project is based on concepts I learned from Rishabh Mishraâ€™s Power BI tutorials, with my own modifications and creativity applied to the analysis and visuals.
